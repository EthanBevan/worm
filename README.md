*About the Worm*

The Worm is a real-time audience sentiment feedback tool for the classroom and other public speaking scenarios.
It can be set up in a matter of seconds and track any sentiment the presenter can think of.

Anyone can create a profile and then set up a future presentation session. Once a presentation has been created,
the presenter can send their audience a special code to join a voting session.
People with a code can enter it on the homepage, to access their voting page. They can vote as many times they want during a session.
The presenter can then track the sentiment of their audience by viewing a live feed.
